# Quick Kids

I wanted to play 30 Seconds with my seven-year-old, but our set is really old, and there is no way he knows 'Melanie Griffith'. So I made this instead. The grown-ups play the usual cards, and the kids play these ones.

## Development

Michelle and I maintain the clues in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dDswbV5O-VVTHNIRhtP-fa-pZOlWYPqMVDMmPtua_EM/edit?usp=sharing).

I download a CSV to this repo as `data/clues.csv` and run `npm run refresh` to load the updated data.

When working on the site, I'll run `npm start` instead, which refreshes the data from the CSV, builds and watches CSS, and runs a local server.

## Credits

Thanks to Michelle for lots of the clues, and to Aidan for field testing them.
